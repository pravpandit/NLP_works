# Chapter 9 Summary

**Congratulations on completing the first unit of this book! **

In summary, in the first part, we learned and mastered two core principles about prompts:

- Write clear and specific instructions;

- Give the model some time to think, if appropriate.

You also learned the iterative prompt development method and understood that the process of finding the right prompt for your application is very critical.

We also discussed many functions of large language models, including summarization, inference, transformation, and expansion. You also learned how to build a personalized chatbot. In the first part, you should have gained a lot, and I hope that learning in the first part will bring you a pleasant experience.

We hope that you will be inspired to try to create your own application. Please try boldly and share your ideas with us. You can start with a micro project, perhaps it has some practicality, or just an interesting innovation. Please use the experience you gained from the first project to create a better next project, and so on. If you already have a grand project idea, then please do not hesitate to implement it.

Finally, I hope you find the process of completing Part 1 satisfying and thank you for participating. We are eagerly looking forward to your amazing works. Next, we will move on to Part 2!
