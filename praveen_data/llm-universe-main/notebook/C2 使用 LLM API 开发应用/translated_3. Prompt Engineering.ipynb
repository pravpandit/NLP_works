    "In the era of LLM, the word prompt is already familiar to every user and developer. So what exactly is prompt? Simply put, prompt is a synonym for the **input** of the interaction between the user and the big model. That is, the input we give to the big model is called prompt, and the output returned by the big model is generally called completion.\n",

    "For a large language model (LLM) with strong natural language understanding and generation capabilities and capable of processing a variety of tasks, a good prompt design greatly determines the upper and lower limits of its capabilities. How to use prompts to give full play to the performance of LLM? First, we need to know the principles of prompt design, which are the basic concepts that every developer must know when designing prompts. This section discusses two key principles for designing efficient prompts: **writing clear and specific instructions** and **giving the model enough time to think**. Mastering these two points is particularly important for creating reliable language model interactions."

This is like asking a person to solve a difficult math problem in a very short time, and mistakes are inevitable.\n",

    "> ⚠️ When developing and applying language models, it is important to be aware of the risk that they may generate false information. Although the model has been pre-trained on a large scale and has acquired a wealth of knowledge, it does not actually remember all the information it has seen, and it is difficult to accurately judge the boundaries of its own knowledge, and may make incorrect inferences. If a language model is asked to describe a non-existent product, it may construct specious details on its own. This is called \"Hallucination\" and is a major flaw of language models."
