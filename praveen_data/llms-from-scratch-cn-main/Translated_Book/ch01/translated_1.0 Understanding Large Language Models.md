Including foreign ones: GPT, BERT, T5, LLaMA, domestic ones: Qwen, Baichuan, etc. Of course, we also need to know that although the Transformer architecture is the mainstream large model architecture today, there are also large models with non-Transformer architectures.Models, such as RWKV. "3. Plan to build LLM from scratch "This is the focus of this book. This book will explain the framework of the entire large model step by step from the principle level, and build an LLM based on the Transformer architecture from scratch." "Then let's get started. In the large language model, we first start with a preliminary introduction to the concept of LLM." Large language models (LLMs), such as those offered in OpenAI's ChatGPT, are deep neural network models that have been developed over the past few years. They ushered in a new era for Natural Language Processing (NLP). Before the advent of large language models, traditional methods excelled at categorization tasks such as email spam classification and straightforward pattern recognition that could be captured with handcrafted rules or simpler models. However, they typically underperformed in language tasks that demanded complex understanding and generation abilities, such as parsing detailed instructions, conducting contextual analysis, or creating coherent and contextually appropriate original text. For example, previous generations of language models could not write an email from a list of keywords—a task that is trivial for contemporary LLMs.

LargeLanguage models (LLMs) are deep neural network models developed in recent years, such as the ChatGPT model provided by OpenAI. They have ushered in a new era of natural language processing (NLP). Before the advent of large language models, traditional methods performed well in classification tasks such as spam classification and simple pattern recognition, which can be captured with hand-crafted rules or simpler models. However, these methods often perform poorly in language tasks that require complex understanding and generation capabilities, such as parsing detailed instructions, performing contextual analysis, or creating coherent and contextually appropriate raw text. For example, previous generations of language models could not compose an email based on a list of keywords - a task that is trivial for contemporary LLMs.

1. **Large Language Model (LLM)**: LLM is the abbreviation for "Large Language Model", which refers to a deep learning model designed to process and generate natural language. These models usually have a large number of parameters and are able to capture and learn the complex structure and patterns of language.
2. **Deep Neural Network Model**: Deep neural networks are an algorithm in the field of machine learning that recognizes complex relationships in data by simulating the way the human brain processes information. These networks are composed of multiple layers, each of which is able to learn different levels of features in the data.
3. **OpenAI**: OpenAI is an internationalChatGPT is a famous LLM developed by ChatGPT, which can perform various language tasks such as text generation, translation, question answering, etc.
4. **Opened a new era of natural language processing (NLP)**: It means that the emergence of LLM marks an important progress in the field of NLP, enabling machines to process human language more accurately and naturally.
5. **Traditional methods**: refers to the techniques and models used to handle language tasks before the emergence of LLM, such as rule-based systems or simple statistical models.
6. **Classification tasks such as spam classification and simple pattern recognition**: These are some basic NLP tasks, among which spam classification refers to identifying and filtering out unwanted emails, and simple pattern recognition may involve identifying specific patterns or keywords in text.
7. **Can be captured by hand-crafted rules or simpler models**: It means that these tasks are less complex and can be effectively completed by pre-defined rules or algorithms with relatively simple structures, and when the tasks become complex, hand-crafted rules become invalid.
8. **Language tasks that require complex understanding and generation capabilities**: refers to those tasks that not only require the recognition of information in the text, but also require in-depth understanding of the information and further generation of text. This includes understanding complex instructions, performing detailed contextual analysis, or composing fluent and contextually appropriate text.
9. **Previous generations of language models were unable to compose emails based on a list of keywords**:This suggests that early language models have limitations in generating text, and they cannot flexibly use the given information to create coherent text content.

LLMs have remarkable capabilities to understand, generate, and interpret human language. However, it's important to clarify that when we say language models "understand," we mean that they can process and generate text in ways that appear coherent and contextually relevant, not that they possess human-like consciousness or comprehension.

>The annotations and explanations of the sentence are as follows:
1. **Has excellent ability to understand, generate and interpret human language**: This shows that LLM performs well in performing language-related tasks. They can "understand" the meaning of language, generate new language expressions, and interpret and respond to language input.
2. **"Understand"**: Quotation marks are used here to emphasize the technical meaning of the word "understanding", which is different from human understanding of language.
3. **Process and generate text in a way that looks coherent and relevant to the context**: This sentence shows that LLM can generate text that reads smoothly and fits the given context by analyzing large amounts of data and pattern recognition. This ability makes machines more natural and human when processing language.
4. **It does not mean that they have human-like consciousness or understanding**: This is an important distinction, which means that although LLM has made significant progress in simulating language understanding and generation, they do not have real consciousness or self-awareness. Their "understanding" is based on algorithms and data processing, not real understanding based on emotions, experience or subjective consciousness. From the construction of the book later, we know that its essence is still a statistical regression model based on language text.
5. **Comprehension**: In the context of AI, this usually refers to the model’s ability to process input data and its ability to react or generate output based on that data. In LLM, this usually involves complex algorithms and a lot of parameter tuning to simulateCognitive processing of language.
6. **Context-dependent**: LLMs are able to generate or interpret language based on the context of the text, which means that they do not simply generate text according to rules, but are able to take into account the semantic content, contextual clues, and possible implicit meanings of the text.
7. **Processing and generating text**: This involves the two main functions of LLM, namely the understanding (processing) of text and the generation of new text content based on that understanding.

Enabled by advancements in deep learning, which is a subset of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) focused on neural networks, LLMs are trained on vast quantities of text data. This allows LLMs to capture deeper contextual information and subtleties of human language compared to previous approaches. As a result, LLMs have significantficantly improved performance in a wide range of NLP tasks, including text translation, sentiment analysis, question answering, and many more. Another important distinction between contemporary LLMs and earlier NLP models is that the latter were typically designed for specific tasks; whereas those earlier NLP models excelled in their narrow applications, LLMs demonstrate a broader proficiency across a wide range of NLP tasks. The success behind LLMs can be attributed to the transformer architecture which underpins many LLMs, and the vast amounts of data LLMs are trained on, allowing them to capture a wide variety of linguistic nuances, contexts, and patterns that would be challenging to manually encode.
