# Fully unleash the unlimited potential of ChatGPT ‚Äê Practical tips, innovative applications and cutting-edge exploration
Artificial intelligence is changing the way we live and work in unprecedented ways. In this wave, large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT are undoubtedly the most eye-catching stars. As an advanced AI writing assistant, the power of ChatGPT is not only reflected in its ability to output high-quality text, but also in its ability to release more of its potential through specific operations and innovative applications. Here we share a series of practical tips and cutting-edge explorations, let us explore the infinite energy of ChatGPT.

## Break through the word limit and inspiration continues to gush

As writers, we often encounter word limit requirements. Faced with this problem, ChatGPT provides us with a clever solution. We only need to directly ask it to "write more than xxx words" or "continue to write to xxx words", and ChatGPT will continue to add content according to the instructions until the number of words we require is reached. In this way, the word limit is no longer an obstacle, and the fountain of inspiration can continue to gush with the help of ChatGPT. Let's write to your heart's content and express the spark of inspiration in our hearts! 

## Personalized output, let the article wear a custom suit

One of the great pleasures of writing is to show personal characteristics, and ChatGPT can also satisfy our desire for personalized writing style. The key is to provide ChatGPT with sufficient information and examples, and it can perfectly meet our needs.For example, if you need to write a travelogue of a one-day trip to Jiufen, you can first describe the attractions you have actually visited to ChatGPT, and it will create a travelogue with an experiential sense based on your experience.

If you want the travelogue to use a lively and vivid tone, then explicitly ask ChatGPT to "write in the tone of an IG influencer and use emoticons." It will inject vitality into the travelogue with a tone full of youthful vitality as required. You can also give examples, such as rewriting "I want a meeting" to "I want a meeting", etc., and ChatGPT will learn to use a "spiritual body" tone with personal characteristics.

It is not difficult to see that by giving sufficient guidance and examples, ChatGPT can tailor a unique style for us. Just like putting on a unique suit for the text, it makes the work more personalized and attractive!

## Magic spell, activate the fuse of thinking

When asking questions, do you often encounter difficult and complicated problems? ChatGPT may be able to provide some inspiring help in this regard. A study found that adding encouraging phrases such as "let's think", "let's think step by step" or "Let's work this out in a step-by-step way to be sure we have the right answer" to questions increased the probability of ChatGPT answering correctly.can be significantly improved.

What's more, some researchers have found that letting ChatGPT "take a deep breath" before starting to answer can further stimulate its thinking potential and take the problem-solving effect to a higher level. It seems that these simple "spells" have a miraculous effect on starting ChatGPT's cognitive engine!

And these "magic spells" are not nonsense, they are often gradually optimized through AI reinforcement learning. The specific approach is to first train a generator model to generate various different encouragement sentences, and then adjust the generation strategy according to ChatGPT's performance after using these sentences, so as to continuously optimize and generate more efficient motivational sentences.

It is not difficult to see that behind this is the use of innovative technical means to maximize the stimulation of ChatGPT's thinking fuse. In the future, perhaps more magic spells will be discovered to give ChatGPT more powerful cognitive abilities.

## External plug-in interconnection, extending tentacles to the knowledge treasure house

In addition to its powerful internal capabilities, the latest version of ChatGPT can also call nearly 1,000 external plug-in tools to obtain real-time communication with external knowledge bases. For example, you can let ChatGPT connect to the NLPaperReader tool and provide it with a dedicated paper database. In this way, when it is asked to find "papers introducing self-supervised learning of speech", it can directly retrieve relevant papers from the database instead of guessing the answer by text chain, thus ensuring the accuracy andAuthoritativeness.

However, even if it is connected to external tools, ChatGPT is not omnipotent. When you ask it to "introduce the National Taiwan University Rose Festival in 100 words and provide a website address", it will search the Internet but it is still inevitable to make mistakes, and may only give you a news link of "the largest rose garden in Taiwan". It can be seen that external connections only provide some clues for ChatGPT, and it still cannot completely avoid errors. But overall, by connecting with external knowledge bases, ChatGPT's cognitive ability has undoubtedly been greatly improved. It is moving towards a higher level of artificial intelligence assistant.

## Introspection and self-reflection, building advanced feedback loops

In addition to relying on external forces, ChatGPT itself is gradually gaining the ability to evolve itself. The latest version of the GPT-4 model has demonstrated basic self-reflection capabilities. When questioned whether the answer is correct, it can self-check, admit mistakes and try to correct them, while the GPT-3.5 version often simply apologizes without truly reflecting on its own mistakes.

However, human-level self-reflection is not achieved overnight. Researchers are exploring a variety of innovative technologies to enhance the model's introspective ability. One method is "Constitutional AI", which is to let a model answer questions intuitively, and then present its answers to another model of the same type, asking the latter to judge whether there are moral or legal issues. The former then gives a revised answer based on this "internal and external alternation, internal and external bowing" approach can continuously correct the model.own mistakes.

Another interesting way is "adversarial training". The specific approach is to let the two models challenge each other's views: one model gives a preliminary answer first, and the other model is responsible for pointing out the loopholes, and the former then optimizes the answer accordingly. The two models iterate and improve each other in such a "debate", thereby improving the level of cognition.

It is not difficult to see that in the future, models not only need to have a strong knowledge base, but also need to establish an advanced feedback loop of introspection and self-correction, establish a benign interaction with humans, and continuously optimize themselves. This model of human-machine collaboration and common growth may become an important direction for the development of AI.

## Looking forward to integrating into reality! AI intelligence transcends online and offline

At present, language models such as ChatGPT still exist in a purely online form and cannot directly interact with the real world. But some researchers have been committed to breaking this limitation so that language intelligence can perceive and affect the real environment.

One way is to introduce an image recognition module to convert real scenes into text input for language models to understand and analyze; and the text output of the language model can be connected to the mechanical execution arm, thereby affecting the specific state of the real world. Let's take GPT-4 as an example. Through the demonstration, we can see that GPT-4 can output a series of action instructions based on a desktop image to guide the robot arm to organize the items on the desktop into the backpack.

Although the current situation is still a bit rigid and limited, in the future, language models are expected to be deeply integrated with our living environment. It can not only input imagesPerceiving the external world, it can give instructions and feedback that affect reality based on the cognitive results. By then, artificial intelligence will truly intervene in all aspects of human life in a physical form, providing us with a full range of intelligent services.

In general, large language models have been steadily breaking through the boundaries of their own capabilities and striding towards the goal of a true general artificial intelligence assistant. By mastering skills such as word count control, personalized output, magic spells, external interconnection, introspection and self-reflection, we can maximize the infinite potential of language models and achieve unprecedented efficiency improvements in all aspects of work, study and life.

Keeping an open and curious mind and looking forward to the surprises brought by artificial intelligence will surely benefit us a lot from this AI revolution. The future will be a new world, let us wait and see.
