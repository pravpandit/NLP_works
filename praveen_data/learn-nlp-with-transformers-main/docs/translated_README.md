# Introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP) based on transformers
Natural Language Processing with transformers.
This project is aimed at:
- NLP beginners, transformer beginners
- Have a certain foundation in python and pytorch programming
- Interested in cutting-edge transformer models
- Understand and know simple deep learning models

The vision of this project is:

We hope to combine vivid explanations of principles and multiple hands-on practical projects to help beginners quickly get started with NLP in the era of deep learning.

The main references for this project are:
- Huggingface/Transformers code base
- Multiple excellent Transformer explanations and sharing
