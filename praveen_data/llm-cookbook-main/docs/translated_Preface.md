Dear readers: 

&emsp;&emsp;Hello! Welcome to read this "LLM Tutorial for Developers". 

&emsp;&emsp;Recently, large-scale pre-trained language models represented by GPT-4 have attracted much attention. These models have billions to hundreds of billions of parameters, and have acquired very powerful language understanding and generation capabilities by learning large text corpora. At the same time, the API services launched by companies such as OpenAI have made access to these models more convenient than ever before. 

&emsp;&emsp;So how to use these powerful pre-trained models to develop practical applications? This book brings together a series of classic courses on large language models (LLM) created by Professor Andrew Ng of Stanford University in cooperation with OpenAI, and introduces the development skills of large models from model principles to application implementation. 

&emsp;&emsp;This book first introduces the method of prompt engineering. Prompts are the bridge between users and models, and optimizing prompts is crucial to the model effect. Through cases, readers can learn prompt design skills for basic NLP tasks such as text summarization, reasoning, and conversion. 

&emsp;&emsp;Then, this book guides readers to develop a complete and comprehensive intelligent question-answering system based on the API provided by ChatGPT, including the basic specifications of using large language models, evaluating input through classification and supervision, and processing through thought chain reasoning and chain prompts.Processing input, checking and evaluating system output, etc., introduces a new paradigm for development based on large models, which is worth learning for every developer who aspires to develop applications using large models.

&emsp;&emsp;By giving prompts to LLM or large language models, AI applications can now be developed faster than ever before, but an application may require multiple rounds of prompts and parsed outputs. There is a lot of glue code to be written in this process. Based on this demand, Harrison Chase created an open source framework LangChain for building large model applications to make the development process smoother.

&emsp;&emsp;In the Langchain section, readers will learn how to use the ChatGPT API in conjunction with the LangChain framework to build LLM-based applications, helping developers learn some tips for using LangChain, including: models, prompts and parsers, storage required for applications, building model chains, document-based question-answering systems, evaluation and proxy, etc.

&emsp;&emsp;The current mainstream large-scale pre-trained language models, such as ChatGPT (training knowledge as of September 2021), mainly rely on general training data sets and fail to effectively utilize users' own data. This has become an important limitation of the model in answering questions. Specifically, this type of model has noThey cannot use the user's private data, such as personal information, internal company data, etc., to generate personalized responses. They also cannot obtain the user's latest real-time data, but can only stay at the time point of the pre-training data set. This results in the model being unable to give satisfactory answers to many questions that need to be combined with the user's situation. If the language model can be given the ability to directly access the user's own data and allow the model to absorb the user's latest data in real time, the quality of its answers will be greatly improved.

&emsp;&emsp;Finally, this book focuses on how to use LangChain to integrate your own private data, including: loading and cutting local documents; vector databases and word vectors; retrieval answers; Q&A and chat based on private data, etc.

&emsp;&emsp;It can be said that this book covers all aspects of large model application development. I believe that through the study of this book, even if you do not have rich programming experience, you can successfully get started with large models and develop AI products with practical value. Let us jointly promote this revolutionary emerging technology field!
