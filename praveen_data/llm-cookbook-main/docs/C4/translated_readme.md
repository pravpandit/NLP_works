# Part 4 Using LangChain to access personal data

In the era of big data, the value of data has gradually become prominent. Personal data is particularly important for creating customized and personalized services. To develop an application with strong service capabilities and fully demonstrate personalized intelligence, **alignment of large models with personal data** is an important step. As a framework that came into being for large model development, LangChain provides many tools and functions combined with large model development, and the ability to support large models to access personal data is naturally indispensable.

In the previous part, we explained how to develop basic applications based on LangChain. By using the framework and functions provided by LangChain, we can more easily implement diversified functions such as storage, model chain, evaluation, and agency to meet the actual needs of users. In this part, we will **deepen the personal data access capabilities provided by LangChain based on the previous part, and guide developers on how to use LangChain to develop large model applications that can access users' personal data and provide personalized services**. By studying this part, you can further master the advanced capabilities of the LangChain framework and large model development, laying the foundation for actual development for generation needs.
