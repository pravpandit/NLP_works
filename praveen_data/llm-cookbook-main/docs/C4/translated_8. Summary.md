# Chapter 8, Summary

Let's quickly review the main content of this section:

1. Use LangChain's various document loaders to import various types of data from different sources.

2. Segment the document into semantically complete text blocks and discuss some of the subtleties.

3. Create embeddings for these blocks, put them into vector memory, and easily implement semantic search.

4. Discuss some shortcomings of semantic search and search failures that may occur in some edge cases.

5. Introduce a variety of advanced retrieval algorithms to overcome those edge cases.

6. Combine with LLMs, pass the retrieval results and questions to LLM to generate answers to the original questions.

7. Complete the conversation content and create a fully functional, end-to-end chatbot.

By studying this part, we have mastered how to use the LangChain framework to access private data and build a personalized question-answering system. This is a rapidly iterating field, and I hope you can continue to pay attention to new technologies.

Look forward to seeing everyone apply knowledge to practice and create more surprises. Letâ€™s go and continue exploring the infinite possibilities of combining language models with private data!
