# Chapter 8 Summary

This unit tutorial covers a series of practices for building language model applications using LangChain, including processing user comments, document-based Q&A, and seeking external knowledge.

1. Powerful `LangChain`

Through this series of cases, we can deeply appreciate that LangChain has greatly simplified and accelerated the development of language model applications. Functions that used to take weeks to implement can now be quickly built through LangChain with very little code. LangChain has become a powerful paradigm for developing large model applications. I hope everyone will embrace this powerful tool and actively explore more and wider application scenarios.

2. Different combinations, more possibilities

What else can LangChain help us do: answer questions based on CSV files, query SQL databases, and interact with APIs. There are many examples that can be achieved through Chain and different prompts and output parsers.

3. Let's go and explore the new world

Thanks to the contributors of LangChain, you continue to enrich the documents and cases to make this framework easier to learn and use. If you haven't started using LangChain yet, open Python now and run `pip install LangChain` to explore the infinite charm of this magical tool.force!
