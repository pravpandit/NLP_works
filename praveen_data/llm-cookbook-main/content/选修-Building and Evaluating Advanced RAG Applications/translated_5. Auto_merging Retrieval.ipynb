    "In this course, we will explore an advanced retrieval aggregation (RAG) technique - automatic merge retrieval. This approach solves a key problem encountered when using traditional RAG: when retrieving information chunks to fill the language model (LLM) context, if these chunks are too fragmented, it will affect the coherence of the context, especially when the size of these chunks is small. To overcome this challenge, we will adopt an automatic merge heuristic method, which ensures the coherence of the context by merging smaller information chunks into larger parent chunks. Next, we will introduce how to implement this technique in detail and demonstrate its application through practical examples."
