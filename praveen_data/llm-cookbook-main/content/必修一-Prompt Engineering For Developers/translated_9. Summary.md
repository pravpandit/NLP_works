**Congratulations on completing this short course. **

In summary, in this course, we learned two key principles about prompts:

- Write clear and specific instructions;

- Give the model some time to think, if appropriate.

You also learned an iterative approach to prompt development and saw how the process of finding the right prompt for your application is critical.

We also introduced many of the capabilities of large language models, including summarization, inference, transformation, and extension. You also learned how to build a custom chatbot. You learned a lot in this short course and hope you enjoyed the material.

We hope you can come up with some application ideas and try to build them yourself. Please try it out and let us know what you think. You can start with a very small project that may have some practical value or may not have any practical value at all, just something fun and interesting. Please use the learning experience of your first project to build a better second project, or even a better third project, etc. Or, if you already have an idea for a bigger project, go for it.

Large language models are very powerful, and as a reminder, we ask that you use them **responsibly** and only build things that have a **positive impact** on others. In this era, people who build AI systems can have a huge impact on others. So these tools must be used responsibly.

Now, based on large languageModel building applications is a very exciting and growing field. Now that you have completed this course, we think you now have a wealth of knowledge that can help you build things that others don't know how to build today. So I hope you will also help us spread the word and encourage others to take this course as well.

Finally, I hope you had fun completing this course and thank you for completing it. We look forward to hearing about the amazing things you build.
