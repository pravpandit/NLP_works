    "# Chapter 3 Iterative Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "When building applications with LLM, it is difficult to successfully get a prompt that is suitable for the final application on the first try. But it doesn't matter. As long as you have a good iterative process to continuously improve your prompt, you will be able to get a prompt that is suitable for the task. Although the chance of success in the prompt may be higher than training a machine learning model, as mentioned above, it is not important whether the prompt is perfected in one go. The most important thing is the process of **iteration** to find an effective prompt for your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, in this chapter, we will use the example of generating marketing copy in the product manual to show some process frameworks and prompt you to think about how to analyze and improve your prompt iteratively.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Andrew Ng's machine learning course, a chart is shown to illustrate the process of machine learning development. Usually, you have an idea first, and then implement it with the following process: write code, get data, train the model, and get experimental results. Then you can view the results, analyze errors and mistakes, find out the applicable areas, and even change your specific ideas or solutions for specific problems. After that, change the implementation again, run another experiment, and so on, iterating over and over again until you get a valid machine learning model. When writing a prompt for an LLM-based application, the process can be veryOnce you have an idea of ​​what you want to accomplish, you can try to write the first prompt, paying attention to the two principles mentioned in the previous chapter: **clear and specific, and give the system enough time to think**. Then you can run it and see the results. If the first effect is not good, the iterative process is to find out why the instructions are not clear enough or why the algorithm is not given enough time to think, so as to improve the idea, improve the prompt, and so on, and cycle many times until you find a prompt that suits your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is difficult to have a so-called \"best prompt\" that applies to everything in the world. A better approach is to find an effective iterative process so that you can quickly find a prompt that suits your application."

    "The above is a brief example of the iterative process of prompt development that many developers typically go through. My advice is that prompts should be kept clear and explicit, as demonstrated in the previous chapter, and the model should be given some thinking time when necessary. Based on these requirements, a common process is to first try to write a version of the prompt to see what happens, and then continue to iterate and improve the prompt to gradually approach the desired result. Many successful prompts are derived through this iterative process. I will show you a more complex prompt example that may give you a deeper understanding of ChatGPT's capabilities."

    "This chapter focuses on the iterative prompt development process of LLM in developing applications. Developers need to try to write prompts first, and then gradually improve them through iterations until they get the desired results. As an efficient prompt engineer, the key is to master the process of effectively developing prompts, rather than seeking to get a \"perfect\" prompt. For some more complex applications, you can iteratively develop prompts for multiple samples (such as hundreds of manuals) and evaluate them on the sample set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, in more mature applications, you can observe the performance of multiple prompts on multiple sample sets and test the average or worst performance. But generally, **only** when** the application is more mature, it is recommended that you use this evaluation method to keep improving.\n",
