# Chapter 8, Summary

Let's quickly review the main content of this section:

1. Learn keyword search and use keyword search for simple question and answer.

2. Learn the basic principles of Embeddings and call cohere's API to map text into Embeddings space.

3. Learn the basic principles of dense search and compare the advantages and disadvantages of keyword search and dense search. Secondly, we also built a vector index from scratch.

4. Learn the ReRank algorithm and the evaluation indicators of semantic search.

5. Learn how to insert search results into LLMs and let it generate answers based on these results.

By studying this part, we learned how to combine large models with semantic search. This is a rapidly iterating field, and I hope you can continue to pay attention to new technologies. Let's continue to learn and continue to explore the infinite possibilities of combining language models and semantic search!
