    "# Chapter 2 Keyword Search\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you will learn how to use keyword search and use the database to answer questions. Search is common in our daily lives. It includes search engines and also includes searching within applications, such as searching in Spotify, YouTube, or Google Maps. Companies and organizations also need to use keyword search or various other search methods to search their internal files. Keyword search is the most common way to build search systems. Next, let's look at how to use keyword search systems, and then see how language models can improve these systems.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the previous code, we have connected to the database. Now let's build a function to query the database. We call it \"keyword_search\".\n",
    "\n",
    "From the above introduction, we can see that the **BM25 algorithm** is used in the keyword search function to calculate the relevance score between the query and the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's first introduce the TF-IDF algorithm, which is a common text analysis technique that measures the importance of words in a document by multiplying the term frequency (TF) with the inverse document frequency (IDF). The term frequency is the frequency of each term in the document. The inverse document frequency is a measure of the importance of a term. However, the TF-IDF algorithm has some shortcomings when calculating the relevance between a document and a query, such as not considering the impact of document length and document frequency on the weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "The BM25 algorithm is a classic search algorithm, which is an improvement on the traditional TF-IDF algorithm. BM25 calculates the relevance score between a document and a query by considering the term frequency, document length, and inverse document frequency of the term, thereby more accurately evaluating the relevance of the document. This improvement enables BM25 to perform better in information retrieval tasks and better meet the needs of practical applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following are the key points of the BM25 algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) **Document and query: **\n",
    "\n",
    "BM25 algorithm measures the relevance of a document by calculating the relevance score between each term in the document and the term in the query. This relevance score is calculated based on the frequency (TF) of each term in the document and the inverse document frequency (IDF) of the entire document collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) **TF (term frequency) factor**:\n",
    "\n",
    "BM25 takes into account the influence of term frequency, but compared to TF-IDF, it uses a smoother way to handle term frequency. Specifically, BM25 uses the following formula for calculating word frequency:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{TF}(t, d) = \\frac{f(t, d) \\times (k_1 + 1)}{f(t, d) + k_1 \\times (1 - b + b \\times \\frac{|d|}{\\text{avgdl}})}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- ${f}(t,d)$ represents the term\n",
    "- $d$ represents the length of document d.\n",
    "- avgdl represents the average document length.\n",
    "- $k_1$ and b are adjustment parameters used to balance the impact of TF and document length.\n",
    "\n",
    "(3) **IDF (Inverse Document Frequency) Factor**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to TF-IDF, BM25 also considers the inverse document frequency of the term. IDF can be calculated using the traditional $\\log(\\frac{N - n + 0.5}{n + 0.5})$, or other variants.\n",
    "N represents the total number of documents in the document collection.\n",
    "- N represents the total number of documents in the document collection.\n",
    "- n represents the number of documents containing term t.\n",
    "\n",
    "(4) Adjustment parameters $k_1$ and b are two adjustment parameters in BM25, which are used to balance the influence of TF and document length. Generally, their selection depends on the specific application and dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "(5) Final score calculation:\n",
    "\n",
    "The final BM25 score is the weighted sum of TF and IDF of each query term, and then the scores of all query terms are added up to get the total score of the document."

They argued that the close relationships between journalists and developers demonstrated a conspiracy among reviewers to focus on progressive social issues. Some supporters pointed to what they considered disproportionate praise for games such as \"Depression Quest\" and \"Gone Home\", which feature unconventional gameplay and stories with social implications, while they viewed traditional AAA games as downplayed. False claims of the \"ethics in game journalism\" had started as early as 2012, when Geoff Keighley was accused of such unethical behavior when he was presenting information about \"Halo 4\" among advertisements for Mountain Dew and Doritos, an event called \"Doritosgate\" in the game.mer culture.\n",

    "text:West Germany (established in May 1949) was not eligible for the 1950 World Cup (the first after the war), and so all preparations were made with a view toward the 1954 matches in Bern, Switzerland. By that time Adidas's football boots were considerably lighter than the ones made before the war, based on English designs. At the World Cup Adi had a secret weapon, which he revealed when West Germany made the finals against the overwhelmingly favored Hungarian team, which was undefeated since May 1950 and had defeated West Germany 8–3 in group play. Despite this defeat, West Germany made the knock-out rounds by twice defeating Turkey handily. The team defeated Yugoslavia and Austria to reach the final (a remarkable achievement), where the hope of many German fans was simply that the team \"avoid another humiliating defeat\" at the hands of the Hungarians. The day of the final began with light rain, which brightened the prospectsof the West German team who called it \"\"Fritz Walter-Wetter\"\" because the team's best player excelled in muddy conditions. Dassler informed Herberger before the match of his latest innovation—\"screw in studs.\" Unlike the traditional boot which had fixed leather spike studs, Dassler's shoe allowed spikes of various lengths to be affixed depending on the state of the pitch. As the playing field at Wankdorf Stadium drastically deteriorated, Herberger famously announced, \"Adi, screw them on.\" The longer spikes improved the footing of West German players compared to the Hungarians whose mud-caked boots were also much heavier. The West Germans staged a come from behind upset, winning 3-2, in what became known as the \"Miracle in Bern.\" Herberger publicly praised Dassler as a key contributor to the win, and Adidas's fame rose both in West Germany, where the win was considered a key post-war event in restoring German self-esteem and abroad, where in the first televised World Cup final viewerswere introduced to \"the ultimate breakthrough.\"\n",

    "text:In ancient times, \"China\" had different meanings: some referred to the capital where the emperor was located as \"China\". 《》: \"Benefit this China to pacify the four directions.\" Mao Zhuan: \"China is the capital.\" 《》: \"Then the emperor will take the throne there.\" 《Collected Explanations》: \"Liu Xi said; 'The capital of the emperor is the center, so it is called China'.\" Some referred to the Huaxia and Han areas as China (because it is among the four barbarians). 《》: \"When the \"Xiaoya\" was completely abolished, the four barbarians invaded each other and China became insignificant.\" Also 《》: \"Therefore, the reputation spread throughout China and even to the barbarians.\" The Huaxia people mostly built their capitals in the south and north of the Yellow River, so they called their place \"China\", which has the same meaning as \"Middle Earth\", \"Central Plains\", \"Zhongzhou\", \"Zhongxia\" and \"Zhonghua\". At first, it referred to the northern part of Henan Province, the southern part of Shanxi Province and the southern part of Shaanxi Province and nearby areas. Later, the scope of activities of the Central Plains Dynasty expanded, and the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River were also called \"China\". Or it refers to the country that governs the Central Plains. \"The Book of Jin\": \"Yue Da then united Wu and Shu, and secretly planned to conquer China.\" The areas under its jurisdiction, including those that did not belong to the Yellow River basin, were also all called \"China.\" \"The Book of Jin\": \"Afterwards, Qin used its army to destroy the six kingdoms and annex China.\" In the unified situation, the central dynasty often called itself \"China\"; and in the period of division, \"China\" could also refer to the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River (i.e. the Central Plains) or the dynasty that continued the orthodoxy. \"Book of Jin·Chronicle 14\" Fu Jian said to his brother Fu Rong, \"Liu Chan may not be the descendant of the Han Dynasty, but he was eventually annexed by China.\" Here, \"China\" refers to the Wei Kingdom in North China during the Three Kingdoms period, because Wei inherited the orthodoxy of the Han Dynasty. In addition, in ancient times, \"China\"The word \"country\" can also be used to refer to the Han nationality alone. <br>\n",

    "Next, let's review **search** at a higher level.\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown in the figure below, the main components of search include **query**, **search system**, and **previously processed databases (Document Archive)** that the search system can access. The search system responds with a series of search results in descending order of relevance of the data in the database to the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Alt ​​text](images/2-1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "If we look more closely, we can think of **search system** as having two stages. The first stage is usually the **retrieval** stage, followed by a stage called **reranking**. Retrieval will produce an initial ranking result based on a ranking algorithm (such as TF-IDF, BM25, etc.), but it may not always be the order that best matches the user's intent. Reranking refers to the process of further ranking these results after the initial ranking results are returned by Retrieval. Reranking can be based on various factors, such as semantic relevance, user preferences, domain-specific informationetc. Reranking is usually necessary because we want to include or introduce other information besides text relevance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, the implementation of the first stage of Retrieval usually requires **Inverted Index**. Inverted Index is a commonly used data structure in the field of information retrieval, which is used to quickly find documents containing a specific term. Its basic idea is to associate each term in a document collection with a list of documents containing the term, so as to quickly locate the document containing the term through the term.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the figure below, we can see that Inverted Index has two columns, one for keywords and the other for the document ID containing the keyword. Such a structure enables search engines to quickly locate documents containing user query terms, thereby supporting efficient information retrieval. In actual application scenarios, Inverted Index also records the position information and frequency of occurrence of the term in the document, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Alt ​​text](images/2-2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "When we enter query = \"What color is the sky?\", we can see that in the Inverted Index, the word \"color\" corresponds to document 804, and the word \"sky\" also corresponds to document 804. Therefore, 804 will score highly in the results retrieved in the first phase."
