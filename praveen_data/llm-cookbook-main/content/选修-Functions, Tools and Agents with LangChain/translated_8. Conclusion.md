# Chapter 8 Summary 

With the development of the times, this course brings the latest progress and features in the field of AI, namely OpenAI function calls and LangChain's expression language.

We also discussed in depth how to use them for structured data extraction, as well as the skills of flexible use and selection of tools.

Finally, practice makes perfect, and we put all the learned techniques into practice by building a conversational agent to integrate everything.

Now, we have mastered such technology! The only thing we need to do is to go to the real world, apply them to your actual scenarios, and set off a new wave! ðŸŒŠâœ¨
