    "\n",
    "+ Causal language modeling (CLM): The model needs to predict the character at the next position in the sentence (similar to the decoder and GPT of BERT-like models, where characters are input from left to right). To ensure that the model does not cheat, an attention mask is used to prevent the model from seeing the characters after. For example, when the model tries to predict the character at position i+1 in the sentence, this mask will prevent it from accessing characters after position i.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Inference Representation Causal Language Modeling Task Image](./images/causal_language_modeling.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Masked language modeling (MLM): The model needs to recover some characters that were \"MASKed\" out of the input (pre-training task for BERT-like models). This way the model can see the entire sentence, so the model can predict the character before the \"\\[MASK\\]\" tag based on the characters before and after the \"\\[MASK\\]\" tag.\n",
