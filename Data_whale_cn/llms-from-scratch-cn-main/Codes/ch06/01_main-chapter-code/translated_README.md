# Chapter 6: Fine-tuning for text classification

- [ch06.ipynb](ch06.ipynb) contains all the code that appears in this chapter
- [previous_chapters.py](previous_chapters.py) is a Python module that contains the GPT model we coded and trained in the previous chapters, as well as many utility functions that we reuse in this chapter
- [gpt-class-finetune.py](gpt-class-finetune.py) is a standalone Python script file that contains the code we implemented in [ch06.ipynb](ch06.ipynb) to fine-tune the GPT model (you can think of it as a chapter summary)
- [gpt_download.py](gpt_download.py) contains utility functions for downloading pre-trained GPT model weights
- [exercise-solutions.ipynb](exercise-solutions.ipynb) contains the exercises for this chapter
