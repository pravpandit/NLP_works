    "The rapid rise of AI has led to a rapid rise in AI jobs, and many people are building exciting careers in this field. A career is a decades-long journey, and the path is not always straightforward. Over many years, I’ve been privileged to see thousands of students as well as engineers in companies large and small navigate careers in AI. In this and the next few letters, I’d like to share a few thoughts that might be useful in charting your own course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Three key steps of career growth are learning (to gain technical and other skills), working on projects (to deepen skills, build a portfolio, and create impact) and searching for a job. These steps stack on top of each other:\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, you focus on gaining foundational technical skills.\n",
    "After having gained foundational skills, you lean into project work. During this period, you’ll probably keep learning.\n",
    "Later, you might occasionally carry out a job search. Throughout this process, you’ll probably continue to learn and work on meaningful projects.\n",
    "These phases apply in a wide range of professions, but AI involves unique elements. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "AI is nascent, and many technologies are still evolving. While the foundations of machine learning and deep learning are maturing — and coursework is an efficient way to master them — beyond these foundations, keeping up-to-date with changing technology is more important in AI than fields that are more mature.\n",
    "Project work often means working with stakeholders who lack expertise in AI. This can make it challenging to find a suitable project, estimate the project’s timeline and return on investment, and set expectations. In addition, the highly iterative nature of AI projects leads to special challenges in project management: How can you come up with a plan for building a system when you don’t know in advance how long it will take to achieve the target accuracy? Even after the system has hit the target, further iteration may be necessary to address post-deployment drift.\n",
    "While searching for a job in AI can be similar to searching for a job in other sectors, there are some differences. Many companies are still trying to figure out which AI skills they need and how to hire people who have them. Things you’ve worked on may be significantly different than anything your interviewer has seen, and you’re more likely to have to educate potential employers about some elements of your work.\n",
    "Throughout these steps, a supportive community is a big help. Having a group of friends and allies who can help you — and whom you strive to help — makes the path easier. This is true whether you’re taking your first steps or you’ve been on the journey for years.\n",
    "\n",
    "I’m excited to work with all of you to grow the global AI community, and that includes helping everyone in our community develop their careers. I’ll dive more deeply into these topics in the next few weeks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Last week, I wrote about key steps for building a career in AI: learning technical skills, doing project work, and searching for a job, all of which is supported by being part of a community. In this letter, I’d like to dive more deeply into the first step.\n",
    "\n",
    "More papers have been published on AI than any person can read in a lifetime. So, in your efforts to learn, it’s critical to prioritize topic selection. I believe the most important topics for a technical career in machine learning are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Foundational machine learning skills. For example, it’s important to understand models such as linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, decision trees, clustering, and anomaly detection. Beyond specific models, it’s even more important to understand the core concepts behind how and why machine learning works, such as bias/variance, cost functions, regularization, optimization algorithms, and error analysis.\n",
    "Deep learning. This has become such a large fraction of machine learning that it’s hard to excel in the field without some understanding of it! It’s valuable to know the basics of neural networks, practical skills for making them work (such as hyperparameter tuning), convolutional networks, sequence models, and transformers.\n",
    "Math relevant to machine learning. Key areas include linear algebra (vectors, matrices, and various manipulations of them) as well as probability and statistics (including discrete and continuous probability, standard probability distributions, basic rules such as independence and Bayes rule, and hypothesis testing). In addition, exploratory data analysis (EDA) — using visualizations and other methods to systematically explore a dataset — is an underrated skill. I’ve found EDA particularly useful in data-centric AI development, where analyzing errors and gaining insights can really help drive progress! Finally, a basic intuitive understanding of calculus will also help. In a previous letter, I described how the math needed to do machine learning well has been changing. For instance, although some tasks require calculus, improved automatic differentiation software makes it possible to invent and implement new neural network architectures without doing any calculus. This was almost impossible a decade ago.\n",
    "Software development. While you can get a job and make huge contributions with only machine learning modeling skills, your job opportunities will increase if you can also write good software to implement complex AI systems. These skills include programming fundamentals, data structures (especially those that relate to machine learning, such as data frames), algorithms (including those related to databases and data manipulation), software design, familiarity with Python, and familiarity with key libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, and scikit-learn.\n",
    "This is a lot to learn! Even after you master everything in this list, I hope you’ll keep learning and continue to deepen your technical knowledge. I’ve known many machine learning engineers who benefitted from deeper skills in an application area such as natural language processing or computer vision, or in a technology area such as probabilistic graphical models or building scalable software systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do you gain these skills? There’s a lot of good content on the internet, and in theory reading dozens of web pages could work. But when the goal is deep understanding, reading disjointed web pages is inefficient because they tend to repeat each other, use inconsistent terminology (which slows you down), vary in quality, and leave gaps. That’s why a good course — in which a body of material has been organized into a coherent and logical form — is often the most time-efficient way to master a meaningful body of knowledge. When you’ve absorbed the knowledge available in courses, you can switch over to research papers and other resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, keep in mind that no one can cram everything they need to know over a weekend or even a month. Everyone I know who’s great at machine learning is a lifelong learner. In fact, given how quickly our field is changing, there’s little choice but to keep learning if you want to keep up. How can you maintain a steady pace of learning for years? I’ve written about the value of habits. If you cultivate the habit of learning a little bit every week, you can make significant progress with what feels like less effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last two letters, I wrote about developing a career in AI and shared tips for gaining technical skills. This time, I’d like to discuss an important step in building a career: project work.\n",
    "\n",
    "It goes without saying that we should only work on projects that are responsible and ethical, and that benefit people. But those limits leave a large variety to choose from. I wrote previously about how to identify and scope AI projects. This and next week’s letter have a different emphasis: picking and executing projects with an eye toward career development.\n",
    "\n",
    "A fruitful career will include many projects, hopefully growing in scope, complexity, and impact over time. Thus, it is fine to start small. Use early projects to learn and gradually step up to bigger projects as your skills grow.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you’re starting out, don’t expect others to hand great ideas or resources to you on a platter. Many people start by working on small projects in their spare time. With initial successes — even small ones — under your belt, your growing skills increase your ability to come up with better ideas, and it becomes easier to persuade others to help you step up to bigger projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "What if you don’t have any project ideas? Here are a few ways to generate them:\n",
    "\n",
    "Join existing projects. If you find someone else with an idea, ask to join their project.\n",
    "Keep reading and talking to people. I come up with new ideas whenever I spend a lot of time reading, taking courses, or talking with domain experts. I’m confident that you will, too.\n",
    "Focus on an application area. Many researchers are trying to advance basic AI technology — say, by inventing the next generation of transformers or further scaling up language models — so, while this is an exciting direction, it is hard. But the variety of applications to which machine learning has not yet been applied is vast! I’m fortunate to have been able to apply neural networks to everything from autonomous helicopter flight to online advertising, partly because I jumped in when relatively few people were working on those applications. If your company or school cares about a particular application, explore the possibilities for machine learning. That can give you a first look at a potentially creative application — one where you can do unique work — that no one else has done yet.\n",
    "Develop a side hustle. Even if you have a full-time job, a fun project that may or may not develop into something bigger can stir the creative juices and strengthen bonds with collaborators. When I was a full-time professor, working on online education wasn’t part of my “job” (which was doing research and teaching classes). It was a fun hobby that I often worked on out of passion for education. My early experiences recording videos at home helped me later in working on online education in a more substantive way. Silicon Valley abounds with stories of startups that started as side projects. So long as it doesn’t create a conflict with your employer, these projects can be a stepping stone to something significant.\n",
    "Given a few project ideas, which one should you jump into? Here’s a quick checklist of factors to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "Will the project help you grow technically? Ideally, it should be challenging enough to stretch your skills but not so hard that you have little chance of success. This will put you on a path toward mastering ever-greater technical complexity.\n",
    "Do you have good teammates to work with? If not, are there people you can discuss things with? We learn a lot from the people around us, and good collaborators will have a huge impact on your growth.\n",
    "Can it be a stepping stone? If the project is successful, will its technical complexity and/or business impact make it a meaningful stepping stone to larger projects? (If the project is bigger than those you’ve worked on before, there’s a good chance it could be such a stepping stone.)\n",
    "Finally, avoid analysis paralysis. It doesn’t make sense to spend a month deciding whether to work on a project that would take a week to complete. You'll work on multiple projects over the course of your career, so you’ll have ample opportunity to refine your thinking on what’s worthwhile. Given the huge number of possible AI projects, rather than the conventional “ready, aim, fire” approach, you can accelerate your progress with “ready, fire, aim.”\n",

    "人工智能的迅速崛起导致了相关工作的迅速增加，许多人开始在这个领域建立起令人兴奋的职业生涯。职业生涯是一个长达几十年的旅程，且道路并不总是一帆风顺的。多年来，我有幸看到成千上万的学生以及来自不同规模公司的工程师在人工智能领域工作。在今天这封信和接下来的几封信中，我将与大家分享一些可能对你制定职业规划有用的想法。\n",
    "\n",
    "职业发展的三个关键步骤是学习（获得技术和其他技能），参与项目（深化技能，建立一个组合，创造影响）和找到一份合适的工作。将这些步骤叠加在一起：\n",
    "\n",
    "最初，你需要专注于获得基本的技术技能。\n",
    "在获得基本技能之后，你开始投入项目工作。在此期间，你可能会继续学习。\n",
    "之后，你可能偶尔会进行求职。在这个过程中，你可能会继续学习并在有意义的项目上工作。\n",
    "这些阶段适用于广泛的职业，但人工智能涉及独特的元素。例如:\n",
    "\n",
    "人工智能刚刚起步，许多技术仍在发展。虽然机器学习和深度学习的基础正在成熟（上课是掌握它们的有效途径），但在这些基础之外，与更成熟的领域相比，与不断变化的技术保持同步在人工智能领域更为重要。\n",
    "项目实践通常意味着与缺乏 AI 专业知识的利益相关者合作。这使得我们很难找到一个合适的项目、准确估计项目的时间和投资回报以及设定预期。此外，AI 项目的高度迭代特性导致了项目管理中的特殊挑战：当你无法提前知道需要多长时间才能达到目标精度时，如何才能提出一个构建系统的计划？即使系统已经达到目标，进一步的迭代可能是必要的，目的是应对部署后可能发生的漂移问题。\n",
    "虽然在人工智能领域找工作与在其他领域找工作类似，但也有一些区别。许多公司仍在努力弄清楚他们需要哪些人工智能技能，以及如何雇佣拥有这些技能的人。你实践过的事情可能和面试官看到的有很大的不同，你可能更需要向潜在雇主介绍你工作中的一些细节。\n",
    "\n",
    "纵观这些步骤，一个可以相互支持的社区也是一个很大的帮助。拥有一群可以帮助你的朋友和盟友（当然你也努力去帮助他们）会让这条路更好走。无论你是刚刚迈出人生的第一步，还是已经在这条路上走了好几年，一个可以共同进步的社区对你来说都是大有裨益的。\n",
    "\n",
    "我很高兴能与你们所有人一起发展全球人工智能社区，包括帮助我们社区的每个人发展他们的职业生涯。我将在接下来的几周更深入地探讨这些话题。\n",
    "\n",
    "在上周的来信中，我讨论了关于在人工智能领域建立职业生涯的关键步骤：学习技术技能、开展项目实践和寻找工作，所有这些都是通过成为 AI 社区的一员为支撑的。在本周的来信中，我想更深入地探讨第一步——学习技术技能。\n",
    "\n",
    "在人工智能领域发表的论文比任何人一生能读到的都要多。因此，在你努力学习的过程中，选择一个专注的方向是至关重要的。我认为机器学习技术行业中最重要的主题是：\n",
    "\n",
    "基础机器学习技术。例如，了解线性回归、逻辑回归、神经网络、决策树、聚类和异常检测等模型很重要。除了特定模型之外，更重要的是了解机器学习如何及为什么工作的核心概念，例如偏差/方差、损失函数、正则化、优化算法和错误分析。\n",
    "深度学习。这已经占据了机器学习的很大一部分，如果不了解它，就很难在该领域出类拔萃！了解神经网络的基础知识、使其运作的实用技能（如超参数调整）、卷积网络、序列模型和 transformer 都是非常重要的。\n",
    "与机器学习相关的数学知识。关键内容包括线性代数（向量、矩阵和它们的各种使用）以及概率和统计学（包括离散和连续概率、标准概率分布、基本规则，如独立性和贝叶斯定理，以及假设测试）。此外，探索性数据分析（exploratory data analysis, EDA，使用可视化和其他方法系统探索数据集）是一种被低估的技术。我发现 EDA 在以数据为中心的人工智能开发中特别实用，在这种开发中，分析错误和获得见解可以真正帮助推动进步！最后，对微积分的基本直观理解也会对你有所帮助。在之前的一封信中，我描述了学好机器学习所需的数学知识是如何随之变化的。例如，尽管有些任务需要微积分，但改进后的自动微分软件使发明和实现新的神经网络架构成为可能，且无需进行任何微积分操作。这在十年前几乎是不可能的。\n",
    "软件开发。虽然你只需要机器学习建模技能就可以找到工作并做出巨大贡献，但如果你同时能编写好的软件来实现复杂的人工智能系统，那么你的工作机会就会进一步增加。这些技能包括编程基础知识、数据结构（尤其是与机器学习相关的数据结构，如数据帧）、算法（包括与数据库和数据操作相关的算法）、软件设计、熟悉 Python 以及熟悉关键库（如 TensorFlow 或 PyTorch）和 scikit-learn。\n",
    "\n",
    "我们有很多东西要学！即使你掌握了这份清单中的所有内容，我也希望你能继续学习，继续加深你的技术知识。我认识许多机器学习工程师，他们在很多领域，例如应用领域（如自然语言处理或计算机视觉）或技术领域（如概率图形模型或构建可扩展的软件系统）都 A 得了更高级的技能。\n",
    "\n",
    "如何获得这些技能？互联网上有很多好的内容，理论上阅读几十个网页都是很有帮助的。但是，当你的目标是深入理解时，阅读不连贯的网页其实是低效的，因为它们往往会相互重复、使用不一致的术语（这会减慢你的学习速度）、内容质量参差不齐等。这就是为什么一门好的课程——在这门课程中，一系列学习材料被组织成一种连贯和逻辑的形式——往往是掌握一个有意义的知识体系最有效的方式。当你吸收了课程中的可用知识后，你可以转向研究论文和其他资源。\n",
    "\n",
    "最后，请记住，没有人能在一个周末甚至一个月内把他们需要知道的一切塞满大脑。我认识的每一个擅长机器学习的人都是终身学习者。事实上，考虑到我们的领域变化如此之快，如果你想跟上，除了继续学习之外别无他法。如何保持多年稳定的学习节奏？我写过关于“习惯的价值”的文章（The Best Way to Build a New Habit）。如果你养成了每周学习一会的习惯，就能用更少的努力获取显著的进步。\n",
    "\n",
    "在最近的两封信中，我谈及了有关在人工智能领域发展职业生涯的内容，并分享了获得技术技能的技巧。今天，我想着重讨论一下职业生涯中的一个重要步骤：项目实践。\n",
    "\n",
    "不言而喻的是，我们应当只从事负责任、合乎道德、有益于大众的项目。但在这些限制下我们依然有很多选择。此前我提到过如何识别和界定人工智能项目。本周的来信和下周的来信会有不同的重点：挑选和执行项目时要着眼于职业发展。\n",
    "\n",
    "一个富有成果的职业生涯将包括许多项目，我们希望随着时间的推移这些项目能在范围、复杂性和影响力方面不断扩大。因此，从小处着手是较为有利的。利用早期项目进行学习，随着技能的增长，逐步迈向更大的项目。\n",
    "\n",
    "当你开始创业时，不要寄希望于别人会把好的想法或资源放在盘子里递给你。许多人都是从利用业余时间做一些小项目开始的。随着最初的成功，即便是微小的成功，不断提高的技能也提升了你提出更好想法的能力，并且更容易说服他人帮助你攻克更大的项目。\n",
    "\n",
    "如果你没有任何项目想法呢？可以考虑从以下几点入手：\n",
    "\n",
    "加入现有项目。如果你遇到其他有想法的人，请询问是否能加入他们的项目。\n",
    "保持阅读和与人交谈。每当我花大量时间阅读、学习课程或与领域专家交谈时，我就会迸发出新的灵感。相信你也会的。\n",
    "关注应用领域。许多研究人员正在努力推进基本的人工智能技术——比如，通过发明下一代 transformers 或进一步扩大语言模型——虽然这是一个令人兴奋的方向，但很切实难做到。但是，机器学习尚未涉足的各种应用是潜力巨大的！幸运的是，我能够将神经网络应用于从无人驾驶直升机到在线广告的所有领域，部分原因是我是在很少有人开发这些应用程序的时候加入的。如果你所在的公司或学校关心某个特定的应用程序，请有针对性地探索机器学习的可能性。这可以让你第一眼看到一个潜在的、其他人还没有做过的创造性应用——一个你可以进行独特操作的应用。\n",
    "开发副业。即使你拥有一份全职工作，利用业余时间从事一个有趣的项目，不管这个项目最终能不能有大发展，都可以帮你激发创造力，并加强和其他人工智能开发者的合作。当我还是一名全职教授时，从事在线教育并不是我“工作”的一部分，从事研究和授课理论上才是我的本职工作。但出于对教育的热情，这成了我的一个有趣的爱好。早期在家录制视频的经历帮助我后来以更实质性的方式从事在线教育。硅谷有很多创业公司的故事，这些创业公司都是依托辅助项目起步的。只要不与你的雇主产生冲突，这些项目就可以成为重要事情的垫脚石。\n",
    "\n",
    "如果你有一些项目想法，应该选择哪一个呢？以下是你需要考虑的因素的快速清单：\n",
    "\n",
    "这个项目会帮助你在技术上成长吗？理想情况下，它应该具有足够的挑战性来拓展你的技能，但也不能太困难，以至于你几乎没有成功的机会。这将使你走上掌握更大技术复杂性的道路。\n",
    "你有好的队友一起工作吗？如果没有，有人可以和你进行讨论吗？我们从周围的人身上学到了很多，优秀的合作者将对你的成长产生巨大影响。\n",

Many researchers are trying to advance basic AI technology — say, by inventing the next generation of transformers or further scaling up language models — so, while this is an exciting direction, it is hard.

I’m fortunate to have been able to apply neural networks to everything from autonomous helicopter flight to online advertising, partly because I jumped in when relatively few people were working on those applications. If your company or school cares about a particular application, explore the possibilities for machine learning. That can give you a first look at a potentially creative application — one where you can do unique work — that no one else has done yet.\n",

    "A lot of innovators are trying new applications, for example, they'll ask questions to Lex Fridman's podcast, which is exactly the process we just walked through. They'll do a semantic search on the full text of the podcast. This approach has also been applied to Andrew Huberman's podcast. You can even see this applied to YouTube videos and book transcripts. So people are building applications like this with large language models, often in a search and generative way, and you can also optimize the search component by reranking. Now, you can pause for a moment and try running the code yourself and change the questions you want to ask the model or grab another dataset that you're interested in. You don't always need to copy the code, this is just a quick example."

    "If you are planning to work on a large-scale project, consider using tools like LlamaIndex and LangChain, which can help you extract text from PDF files. In addition, the \"num_generations\" parameter is also an important consideration. During development, if you want to test multiple responses of the model to the same prompt without calling the API every time, using the \"num_generations\" parameter is an effective strategy. We can pass this parameter to the \"code.generate\" function, i.e. \"num_generations=num_generations\". When asking the question, we can set \"num_generations=3\". In this way, we will not only get one result, but three different generated results. This means that the question we provide will be processed by the language model and the model will provide us with three different answers, which will be generated simultaneously."
