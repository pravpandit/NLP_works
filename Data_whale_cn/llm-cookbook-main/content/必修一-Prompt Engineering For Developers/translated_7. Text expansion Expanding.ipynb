    "For example, in a particular phrase, the most likely next word for \"my favorite food\" is \"pizza\", followed by \"sushi\" and \"taco\". So at a temperature of zero, the model will always choose the most likely next word, while at higher temperatures it will also choose one of the less likely words, and at even higher temperatures it may even choose taco, which is only one in five times likely. You can imagine that as the model continues to generate more words, the final response \"my favorite food is pizza\" will diverge from the first response \"my favorite food is taco\". As the model continues, these two responses will also become more and more different.\n",

In all courses, we have been setting the temperature to zero, and if you are trying to build a reliable and predictable system, I think you should choose this temperature. If you try to use the model in more creative ways, perhaps with a wider range of different outputs, you may want to use a higher temperature."
