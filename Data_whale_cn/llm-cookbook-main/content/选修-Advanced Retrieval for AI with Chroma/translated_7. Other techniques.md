# 7. Other technologies

Embedding-based retrieval technology is still a very active research field. In addition to the several solutions we learned in this class, there are some other methods to try to improve the retrieval effect, such as:

- Fine-tune an embedding model
- Fine-tune an LLM for retrieval
- Try a more complex embedding adaptor
- Try other relevance modeling methods
- Try a better chunking method
