# Use ChatGPT API to build a system

The new course on big model development released by Andrew Ng, based on the course "Prompt Engineering for Developers", guides developers on how to develop a complete and comprehensive intelligent question-answering system based on the API provided by ChatGPT, including the basic specifications of using big language models, evaluating inputs through classification and supervision, processing inputs through thought chain reasoning and chain prompts, checking and evaluating system outputs, etc., introducing a new paradigm based on big model development, which is worth learning for every developer who is interested in using big models to develop applications.
