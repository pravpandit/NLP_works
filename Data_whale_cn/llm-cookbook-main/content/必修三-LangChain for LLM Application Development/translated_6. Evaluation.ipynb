There is no single true string that is the best possible answer, there are many different variants, and as long as they have the same semantics, they should be rated as similar. If you use regular expressions for exact matching, you will lose semantic information, and many evaluation indicators that exist so far are not good enough. One of the most interesting and popular ones at the moment is to use language models for evaluation."

    "The question here is, does the travel backpack have inner and outer pockets? The real answer, we created this, is yes. The answer predicted by the model is yes, the travel backpack has multiple practical inner and outer pockets that can easily hold your necessities. Therefore, we can understand that this is a correct answer. It rated it as correct. \n",

    "You have these answers, which are arbitrary strings. There is no single true string that is the best possible answer, there are many different variants, and as long as they have the same semantics, they should be rated as similar. If you use regular expressions for exact matching, you will lose semantic information, and many evaluation metrics that exist so far are not good enough. One of the most interesting and popular ones at the moment is to use language models for evaluation."
