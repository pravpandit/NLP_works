# Chapter 8 Summary

This short course covers a range of LangChain application practices, including processing customer reviews and answering questions based on documents, as well as using LLM to determine when to seek help from external tools (such as websites) to answer complex questions.

**👍🏻 LangChain is so powerful**

Building such applications used to take weeks, but now only very little code is needed to efficiently build the required applications through LangChain. LangChain has become a powerful paradigm for developing large model applications. I hope everyone will embrace this powerful tool and actively explore more and wider application scenarios.

**🌈 Different combinations, more possibilities**

What else can LangChain help us do: answer questions based on CSV files, query sql databases, and interact with apis. There are many examples that can be achieved through Chain and different prompts and output parsers.

**💪🏻 Let's go explore the new world**

So thank you to everyone in the community who has contributed, whether it's helping to improve the documentation, making it easier for others to get started, or building a new Chain to open up a whole new world.

If you haven't done so yet, go to your computer, run pip install LangChain, and then use LangChain and build amazing applications~
