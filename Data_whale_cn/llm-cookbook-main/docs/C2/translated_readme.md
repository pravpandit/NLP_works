# Part 2 Building a Q&A system based on ChatGPT

The emergence of ChatGPT makes real intelligent Q&A possible. Powerful command understanding and natural language generation capabilities are the core of LLM, which supports LLM to think, execute and complete user tasks in a human-like way.

Based on the ChatGPT API, we can quickly and conveniently build a real intelligent Q&A system, truly upgrading "artificial intelligence" to "artificial intelligence".

For developers, **how to build a complete and comprehensive Q&A system based on ChatGPT** is of great practical value and significance.

To build a complete Q&A system based on ChatGPT, in addition to how to build Prompt Engineering described in the previous part, multiple additional steps need to be completed.

For example, processing user input to improve system processing capabilities, using thinking chains and prompt chains to improve Q&A effects, checking input to ensure stable system feedback, and evaluating system effects to achieve further optimization.

**When the ChatGPT API provides sufficient intelligence, the importance of the system is more fully demonstrated in ensuring comprehensive and stable effects. **

Part 2: Building a question-answering system based on ChatGPT, based on the course "Building Systems with the ChatGPT API" published by Andrew Ng.Based on "Part 1 Prompt Engineering for Developers", this part guides developers on how to develop a complete and comprehensive intelligent question-and-answer system based on the API provided by ChatGPT.
Through code practice, the whole process of developing a question-and-answer system based on ChatGPT is realized, and a new paradigm based on large model development is introduced, which is worth learning for every developer who is interested in using large models to develop applications.
If "Part 1 Prompt Engineering for Developers" is the theoretical basis for developers to get started with large model development, then this part is the **most powerful practical basis**.
When studying this part, you should fully practice the provided code, reproduce it yourself, and be able to add and modify the provided code based on your personal interests and expertise to achieve a more personalized and customized question-and-answer system.

The main contents of this part include: checking input through classification and supervision; thinking chain reasoning and prompt chain skills; checking input; evaluating system output, etc.
