# Chapter 11 Summary

**Congratulations on completing the second unit of this book! **

This unit covers a series of ChatGPT application practices, including processing input, reviewing output, and evaluation, and realizes a complete process of building a system.

In this unit, we have a deep understanding of the working mechanism of LLM, explored the specific details of the tokenizer, learned how to evaluate the quality and security of user input, learned how to use thought chains as prompts, learned how to split tasks through chained prompts, and how to check outputs before returning to users. At the same time, we also explored how to evaluate the long-term performance of the system for monitoring and improvement. In addition, we also discussed how to build a responsible system to ensure that the model can provide reasonable and relevant feedback.

Practice is the only way to master true knowledge. Start your journey now and build the exciting application in your heart!
