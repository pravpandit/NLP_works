# Part 3 Developing Applications with LangChain

In the previous two parts, we learned the basic usage guidelines of large language models (Prompt Engineering) and how to build a complete question-and-answer system based on ChatGPT, and have a certain understanding of developing applications based on LLM. However, although LLM provides powerful capabilities and greatly facilitates the development of applications, it is still a task with a large workload for individual developers to quickly and conveniently develop a complete application based on LLM. For LLM development, LangChain came into being. LangChain is an open source framework specially built for LLM development. It realizes the use of many powerful capabilities of LLM and provides a variety of encapsulation tools such as Chain, Agent, Tool, etc. Based on LangChain, applications can be easily developed to maximize the potential of LLM. At present, using LangChin has become one of the necessary capabilities for LLM development.

In this part, we will give an in-depth introduction to LangChain to help learners understand how to use LangChain and develop complete and powerful applications based on LangChain. By studying this section, you will be able to master how to use LangChain to open up a fast track for large model development.The basic skills learned in the previous part can help you quickly become an LLM developer.

The main contents of this part include: introduction to some important concepts; storage; model chain; document-based question and answer; evaluation and agent, etc.
