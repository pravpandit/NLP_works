# Chapter 7 Agents

Large Language Models (LLMs) are very powerful, but they lack certain capabilities that the "dumbest" computer programs can easily handle. LLMs are weak in logical reasoning, calculation, and retrieval of external information, in contrast to the simplest computer programs. For example, language models cannot accurately answer simple calculation questions, and when asked about recent events, their answers may be outdated or wrong because they cannot actively obtain the latest information. This is because current language models only rely on pre-trained data and are "disconnected" from the outside world. To overcome this shortcoming, the `LangChain` framework proposes the solution of `"Agents" (Agents).

**As an external module of the language model, agents can provide support for functions such as calculation, logic, and retrieval, giving the language model extremely powerful reasoning and information acquisition capabilities**.

In this chapter, we will introduce in detail the working mechanism and types of agents, and how to combine them with language models in `LangChain` to build more comprehensive and intelligent applications. The agent mechanism greatly expands the boundaries of language models and is one of the important ways to improve their intelligence. Let's start learning how to unleash the maximum potential of language models through agents.

## 1. Use LangChain built-in tools llm-math and wikipedia

To use agents, we need three things:

- A basic LLM
-Tools we will interact with
- An agent that controls the interaction.

```python
from langchain.agents import load_tools, initialize_agent
from langchain.agents import AgentType
from langchain.python import PythonREPL
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
```

First, let's create a basic LLM 

```python
# The temperature parameter is set to 0.0 to reduce the randomness of the generated answers.
llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0)
```

Next, initialize the `Tools`. We can create custom tools or load pre-built tools. In either case, a tool is a utility chain given a tool `name` and a `description`.

- `llm-math` combines a language model and a calculator for mathematical calculations
- `wikipedia` tool connects to wikipedia through the API to perform search queries.

```python

tools = load_tools(
["llm-math","wikipedia"], 
llm=llm #First step to initialize the model
)
```

Now that we have LLM and tools, let's finally initialize a simple agent (Agents):

```python
# Initialize the agent
agent= initialize_agent(
tools, #The second step to load tools
llm, #The first step to initialize the model
agent=AgentType.CHAT_ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, #Agent type
handle_parsing_errors=True, #Handle parsing errors
verbose = True #Output intermediate steps
)
```

- `agent`: Agent type. Here we use `AgentType.CHAT_ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION`. Among them, `CHAT` means that the agent model is optimized for dialogue; `Zero-shot` means that the agent (Agents) works only on the current operation, i.e. it has no memory; `REACT` stands for prompt template designed for REACT. `DESCRIPTION` decides which tool to use based on the tool's description. (We won't discuss the *REACT framework in this chapter, but you can think of it as a process in which the LLM can loop through the Reasoning and Action steps. It enables a multi-step process to identify the answer.)
- `handle_parsing_errors`: whether to handle parsing errors. When a parsing error occurs, the error information is returned to the big model so that it can be corrected.
- `verbose`: whether to output the intermediate step results.

Answering math questions with agents

```python
agent("Calculate 25% of 300") 
```

> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...
Question: Calculate 25% of 300
Thought: I can use the calculator tool to calculate 25% of 300.
Action:
```json
{
"action": "Calculator",
"action_input": "300 * 0.25"
}
```

Observation: Answer: 75.0
Thought:The calculator tool returned the answer 75.0, which is 25% of 300.
Final Answer: 25% of 300 is 75.0.

> Finished chain.

{'input': 'Calculate 25% of 300', 'output': '25% of 300 is 75.0.'}

**The above process can be summarized as follows**

1. The model gives thoughts on what needs to be done next

<p style="font-family:verdana; font-size:12px;color:green"> <strong>Thinking</strong>: I can use the calculator tool to calculate 25% of 300</p>

It is worth noting that the process of running the inference of the model each time may be different, but the final result is consistent.## 2. Use LangChain built-in tool PythonREPLTool

We create a python agent that can convert customer names into pinyin. The steps are the same as in the previous section:

```python
from langchain.agents.agent_toolkits import create_python_agent
from langchain.tools.python.tool import PythonREPLTool

agent = create_python_agent(
llm, #Use the large language model loaded in the previous section
tool=PythonREPLTool(), #Use Python interactive environment tool REPLTool
verbose=True #Output intermediate steps
)
customer_list = ["Xiaoming","Xiaohuang","Xiaohong","Xiaolan","Xiaoju","Xiaolu",]

agent.run(f"Use the pinyin pinyin library to convert these customer names into pinyin, and print the output list: {customer_list}.") 
```

> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...

Python REPL can execute arbitrary code. Use with caution.

I need to use the pinyin library to convert the names to pinyin. I can then print out the list of converted names.
Action: Python_REPL
Action Input: import pinyin
Observation:
Thought:I have imported the pinyin library. Now I can use it to convert the names to pinyin.
Action: Python_REPL
Action Input: names = ['Xiaoming', 'Xiaohuang', 'Xiaohong', 'Xiaolan', 'Xiaoju', 'Xiaolu']
pinyin_names = [pinyin.get(i, format='strip') for i in names]
print(pinyin_names)
Observation: ['xiaoming', 'xiaohuang', 'xiaohong', 'xiaolan', 'xiaoju', 'xiaolv']

Thought: I have successfully converted the names to pinyin and printed out the list of converted names.
Final Answer: ['xiaoming', 'xiaohuang', 'xiaohong', 'xiaolan', 'xiaoju', 'xiaolv']

> Finished chain.

"['xiaoming', 'xiaohuang', 'xiaohong', 'xiaolan', 'xiaoju', 'xiaolv']"

Run again in debug mode, we can correspond the above 6 steps to the following specific processes

## 3. Define your own tools and use them in agents

In this section, we will **create and use a custom time tool**. **The LangChian tool function decorator can be applied to any function, converting the function into a LangChain tool, making it a tool that can be called by the agent**. We need to add a very detailed documentation string to the function so that the agent knows how to use the function/tool ​​under what circumstances. For example, the following function `time`, we added a detailed documentation string.

```python
# Import tool function decorator
from langchain.agents import tool
from datetime import date

@tool
def time(text: str) -> str:
"""
Returns today's date, for any problem that requires knowing today's date.\
The input should always be an empty string,\This function will always return today's date. Any date calculations should be done outside of this function.
"""
return str(date.today())

# Initialize the agent
agent= initialize_agent(
tools=[time], #Add the time tool just created to the agent
llm=llm, #Initialized model
agent=AgentType.CHAT_ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, #Agent type
handle_parsing_errors=True, #Handle parsing errors
verbose = True #Output intermediate steps
)

# Use the agent to ask for today's date. 
# Note: The agent may sometimes fail (this feature is under development). If an error occurs, try running it again.

**The above process can be summarized as follows**

1. The model gives a thought about what needs to be done next
<p style="font-family:verdana; font-size:12px;color:green"> <strong>Thought</strong>: I need to use the time tool to get today's date</p>

2. The model takes action based on the thought. Because the tools used are different, the output of the Action is also different from before. Here is the outputFor python code
<p style="font-family:verdana; font-size:12px;color:green"> <strong>Action</strong>: Use the time tool and input an empty string</p>

3. The model gets an observation (Observation)
<p style="font-family:verdana; font-size:12px;color:green"><strong>Observation</strong>: 2023-07-04</p>

4. Based on the observation, the model gives a thought (Thought) on what to do next
<p style="font-family:verdana; font-size:12px;color:green"> <strong>Thought</strong>: I have successfully used the time tool to retrieve today's date</p>

5. Give the final answer (Final Answer)
<p style="font-family:verdana; font-size:12px;color:green"> <strong>Final answer</strong>: Today's date is 2023-08-09.</p>
