# Chapter 2 Model, Prompt, and Output Interpreter

In this chapter, we will briefly introduce some important concepts about LLM development: model, prompt, and interpreter. If you have studied the previous two parts, you will be familiar with these three concepts. However, in the definition of LangChain, the definition and use of these three concepts are slightly different from before. We still recommend that you read this chapter carefully to further understand LLM development. At the same time, if you study this part directly, the content of this chapter is an important foundation.

First, we will show you the scenario of calling OpenAI directly to fully explain why we need to use LangChain.

## 1. Call OpenAI directly

### 1.1 Calculate 1+1

Let's take a look at a simple example. We directly use the function `get_completion` encapsulated by the OpenAI interface to let the model tell us: `What is 1+1? `

```python
from tool import get_completion

get_completion("What is 1+1?")
```

'1+1 is equal to 2. '

### 1.2 Expressing Pirate Mail in Mandarin

In the simple example above, the model `gpt-3.5-turbo` provides us with the answer to what 1+1 is. Now, let's move on to a richer and more complex scenario.

Imagine that you are an employee of an e-commerce company. One of your customers is a special customer named Pirate A. He bought a juicer on your platform with the intention of making delicious milkshakes. But during the process, for some reason, the lid of the milkshake suddenly popped off, causing milkshake to splash all over the kitchen wall. Imagine the anger and frustration of this pirate. He wrote an email to your customer service center in a pirate-like English dialect: `customer_email`.

```python
customer_email = """
Well, I am furious now. My blender lid actually flew off and splashed juice all over my kitchen wall!
To make matters worse, the warranty does not cover the cost of cleaning my kitchen.
Dude, come here quickly!
"""
```

When dealing with customers from multicultural backgrounds, our customer service team may encounter some special language barriers. As shown above, we received an email from a pirate customer, and his expression was a little awkward for our customer service team.

To solve this challenge, we set the following two goals:

- First, we wanted the model to translate this email full of pirate dialect into Mandarin, so that the customer service team can more easily understand its content.
- Second, when translating, we expected the model to adopt a calm and respectful tone, which is notIt not only ensures that the information is conveyed accurately, but also maintains a harmonious relationship with customers.

To guide the output of the model, we define a text expression style label, referred to as `style`.

```python
# Mandarin + calm, respectful tone
style = """Formal Mandarin \
Use a calm, respectful, polite tone
"""
```

The next step we need to do is to combine `customer_email` and `style` to construct our prompt: `prompt`

```python
# Ask the model to convert according to the given tone
prompt = f"""Translate the text separated by three backticks\
into a {style} style.
Text: ```{customer_email}```
"""

print("prompt:", prompt)
```

Prompt: 
Translate the text separated by three backticks into a formal Mandarin with a calm, respectful, polite tone
style.
Text: ```
Um, I'm pissed, my blender lid flew off and splashed juice all over my kitchen wall!
To make matters worse, the warranty doesn't cover the cost of cleaning my kitchen.
Man, get here now!
```

The carefully designed `prompt` is ready. Next, just call the `get_completion` method, and we can get the expected output - the original pirate dialect email will be translated into a formal Mandarin expression that is both peaceful and respectful.

```python
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```

I am very sorry, but I am very angry and unhappy now. My blender lid flew off, causing juice to splash all over the wall of my kitchen! What's worse, the warranty does not cover the cost of cleaning my kitchen. Sir/Madam, please come and deal with this problem as soon as possible!

After the language style transfer, we can observe obvious changes: the original words have become more formal, those expressions with extreme emotions have been replaced, and words of gratitude have been added to the text.

> Tips: You can adjust and try different prompts to explore what kind of innovative output the model can bring you. Every attempt may bring you unexpected surprises!

## 2. Using OpenAI through LangChain

In the previous section, we used the encapsulated function `get_completion` and used the OpenAI interface to successfully translate the email full of dialect characteristics.to an email written in standard Mandarin with a calm and respectful tone. Next, we will try to solve this problem using LangChain.

### 2.1 Model

Now let's try to implement the same function using LangChain. Import the conversation model `ChatOpenAI` of `OpenAI` from `langchain.chat_models`. In addition to OpenAI, `langchain.chat_models` also integrates other conversation models. For more details, please refer to the [Langchain official documentation](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/models/chat/integrations.html)(https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/models/chat/integrations.html).

```python
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI

# Here we set the parameter temperature to 0.0 to reduce the randomness of the generated answers.
# If you want to get different and novel answers every time,You can try to adjust this parameter.
chat = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0.0)
chat
```

ChatOpenAI(cache=None, verbose=False, callbacks=None, callback_manager=None, tags=None, metadata=None, client=<class 'openai.api_resources.chat_completion.ChatCompletion '>, model_name='gpt-3.5-turbo', temperature=0.0, model_kwargs={}, openai_api_key='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', openai_api_base='', openai_organization='', openai_proxy='', request_timeout=None, max_retries =6, streaming=False, n=1, max_tokens=None, tiktoken_model_name=None)

<br>

The above output shows that the default model of ChatOpenAI is `gpt-3.5-turbo`

### 2.2 Using prompt templates

In the previous example, we added the Python expression values ​​`style` and `customer_email` to the `prompt` string through [f-strings](https://docs.python.org/zh-cn/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#tut-f-strings).

`langchain` provides an interface for convenient and fast construction and use of prompts.

#### 2.2.1 Expressing Pirate Mail in Mandarin

Now let's see how to use `langchain` to construct prompts!

```python
from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate

# First, construct a prompt template string: `template_string`
template_string = """Translate the text separated by three backticks\
into a {style} style.\
Text: ```{text}```
"""

# Then, we call `ChatPromptTemplatee.from_template()` function to convert the prompt template string `template_string` above to the prompt template `prompt_template`

prompt_template = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(template_string)

print("\n", prompt_template.messages[0].prompt)
```

input_variables=['style', 'text'] output_parser=None partial_variables={} template='Translate the text separated by three backticks into a {style} style. Text: ```{text}```\n' template_format='f-string' validate_template=True

<br>

For a given `customer_style` and `customer_email`, we can use the `format_me` of the prompt template `prompt_template`ssages` method generates the desired customer messages `customer_messages`.

The prompt template `prompt_template` requires two input variables: `style` and `text`. Here they correspond to 
- `customer_style`: the customer email style we want
- `customer_email`: the original email text of the customer.

```python
customer_style = """Formal Mandarin \
Use a calm, respectful tone
"""

customer_email = """
Well, I'm pissed off because my blender lid flew off and splashed juice all over my kitchen wall!
To make matters worse, the warranty doesn't cover cleaning my kitchen.
Hey, get over here!
"""

# Use prompt templates
customer_messages = prompt_template.format_messages(
style=customer_style,
text=customer_email)
# Print customer message type
print("Customer message type:",type(customer_messages),"\n")

# Print the first customer message type
print("First customer customer message type type:", type(customer_messages[0]),"\n")

# Print the first element
print("First customer customer message type type: ", customer_messages[0],"\n")

```

Customer message type:
<class 'list'> 

First customer customer message type type:
<class 'langchain.schema.messages.HumanMessage'> 

First customer customer message type type: 
content='Translate the text delimited by three backticks into a formal Mandarin Chinese using a calm, respectful tone\nstyle. Text: ```\nWell, I'm pissed off right now because my blender lid flew off and splashed juice all over my kitchen wall! \nTo make matters worse, the warranty doesn't cover cleaning my kitchen. \nHey, get over here! \n```\n' additional_kwargs={} example=False 

<br>As you can see, the variable type of `customer_messages` is a list (`list`) and the element variable type in the list is a langchain custom message (`langchain.schema.HumanMessage`).

<br>

Now we can call the `chat` model defined in the model part to implement the conversion of customer message style.

```python
customer_response = chat(customer_messages)
print(customer_response.content)
```

I'm so sorry, I'm so angry now. My blender lid flew off, causing juice to splash all over the wall of my kitchen! What's worse, the warranty does not cover the cost of cleaning my kitchen. Man, please come and help me solve this problem as soon as possible!

#### 2.2.2 Reply to emails in pirate dialect

So far, we have achieved the tasks in the previous part. Next, let's go a step further and convert the message replied by the customer service staff into pirate-style English and make sure the message is more polite. Here, we can continue to use the langchain prompt template constructed earlier to get our reply message prompt.

```python
service_reply = """Hey,Customer, \
The warranty does not cover the cost of cleaning the kitchen, \
because you misused the blender \
because you forgot to put the lid on before starting it, \
it is your fault. \
Bad luck! Goodbye!

"""

service_style_pirate = """\
A polite tone \
Use pirate style\
"""
service_messages = prompt_template.format_messages(
style=service_style_pirate,
text=service_reply)

print("\n", service_messages[0].content)
```

Translate the text separated by three backticks into a polite tone using pirate style. Text: ```Hey, customer, the warranty does not cover the kitchen cleaning fee because you forgot to close the lid before starting the blender and misused the blender. It's your fault. Bad luck! Goodbye!
```

```python
# Call the chat model defined in the model section to convert the reply message style
service_response = chat(service_messages)
print(service_response.content)
```

Hey, dear customer, the warranty does not cover the cost of cleaning the kitchen because you forgot to close the lid before starting the blender and used the blender by mistake. This is your fault. What bad luck! I wish you a safe journey!

#### 2.2.3 Why do we need prompt templates

When applied to more complex scenarios, prompts may be very long and contain many details. **Using prompt templates allows us to reuse designed prompts more conveniently**. The English version of prompt 2.2.3 gives an example of a prompt template for homework: students study online and submit homework, and prompts are used to grade students' submitted homework.

In addition, LangChain also provides prompt templates for some common scenarios. For example, automatic summarization, question and answer, connecting to SQL databases, and connecting to different APIs. By using LangChain's built-in prompt templates, you can quickly build your own large model application without spending time designing and constructing prompts.

Finally, when we build a large model application, we usually want the model's output to be in a given format, such as using specific keywords to structure the output. Hint 2.2.3 of the English version gives an example of chained reasoning results using a large model -- for the question: *What is the elevation range for the areathat the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into?* By using the LangChain library function, the output uses "Thought", "Action", and "Observation" as the keywords of chain thinking reasoning to make the output structured.

### 2.3 Output Parser

#### 2.3.1 Extracting Information from Customer Reviews Without Output Parser

For a given review `customer_review`, we want to extract information and output it in the following format:

```json
{
"gift": False,
"delivery_days": 5,
"price_value": "pretty affordable!"
}
```

```python
from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate

customer_review = """\
This leaf blower is amazing. It has four settings: \
Blowing candles, breeze, windy city, tornado. \
It arrived in two days, just in time for my wife's \
anniversary gift. \
I think my wife will love it so much that she will be speechless\
So far, I'm the only one who uses it, and I've been using it every other morning to clean leaves off my lawn. \
It's a little more expensive than other leaf blowers, \
but I think the extra features are worth it.
"""

review_template = """\
For the following text, extract the following information from it:

Gift: Is this item intended as a gift for someone else? \
If yes, answer yes; if no or unknown, answer no.

Delivery Days: How many days does it take for the product to arrive? Output -1 if that information is not found.

Price: Extract any sentences about value or price, \
and output them as a comma-delimited Python list.

"""
prompt_template = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(review_template)
print("Prompt template:", prompt_template)
messages = prompt_template.format_messages(text=customer_review)
chat = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0.0)
response = chat(messages)

print("result type:", type(response.content))
print("result:", response.content)
```

prompt template: 
input_variables=['text'] output_parser=None partial_variables={} messages=[HumanMessagePromptTemplate(prompt=PromptTemplate(input_variables=['text'], output_parser=None, partial_variables={}, template='For the following text, extract the following information from it:\n\nGift: Is this item a gift for someone else?

Result type:
<class 'str'>

Result:
{
"Gift": "Yes",
"Delivery days": 2,
"Price": ["It is slightly more expensive than other leaf blowers"]
}

It can be seen that the type of `response.content` is a string (`str`), not a dictionary (`dict`). If we want to extract information from it more conveniently, we need to use the output interpreter in `Langchain`.

#### 2.3.2 Use output parser to extract information from customer reviews

Next, we will show how to use output interpreter.

```python
review_template_2 = """\
For the following text, extract the following information from it:

Gift: Is this item given as a gift to someone else?
If yes, answer yes; if no or unknown, answer no.

Delivery Days: How many days does it take for the product to arrive?If the information is not found, output -1.
