# Chapter 6 Text Conversion

The large language model has powerful text conversion capabilities and can achieve different types of text conversion tasks such as multilingual translation, spelling correction, grammar adjustment, format conversion, etc. Using language models for various conversions is one of its typical applications.

In this chapter, we will introduce how to use language models to implement text conversion functions by programming API interfaces. Through code examples, readers can learn the specific methods of converting input text into the required output format.

Mastering the skills of calling the large language model interface for text conversion is an important step in developing various language applications. The application scenarios of text conversion functions are also very wide. I believe that readers can easily develop powerful conversion programs based on this chapter using large language models.

## 1. Text Translation

Text translation is one of the typical application scenarios of large language models. Compared with traditional statistical machine translation systems, large language model translation is more fluent and natural, and has a higher degree of restoration. By Fine-Tune on large-scale high-quality parallel corpora, the large language model can deeply learn the correspondence between different languages ​​at the levels of vocabulary, grammar, semantics, etc., simulate the conversion thinking of bilinguals, and perform precise conversion of meaning transmission rather than simple word-by-word replacement.

Taking English-Chinese translation as an example, traditional statistical machine translation tends to directly replace English vocabulary, and the word order maintains the English structure, which is prone to the phenomenon of unauthentic use of Chinese vocabulary and unsmooth word order. The large language model can learn the grammatical differences between English and Chinese, and furtherAt the same time, it can also understand the original sentence's intention through the context and select appropriate Chinese words for conversion, rather than rigid literal translation.

These advantages of large language model translation make the generated Chinese text more authentic, fluent, and accurate in meaning. With large language model translation, we can break through the barriers between multiple languages ​​and conduct higher-quality cross-language communication.

### 1.1 Translate to Spanish

```python
from tool import get_completion

prompt = f"""
Translate the following Chinese into Spanish: \ 
```Hello, I want to order a blender.```
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```

Hola, me gustaría ordenar una batidora.

### 1.2 Identify the language

```python
prompt = f"""
Please tell me what language the following text is in: 
```Combien coûte le lampadaire?```
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```This text is in French.

### 1.3 Multi-language translation

```python
prompt = f"""
Please translate the following text into Chinese, English, French and Spanish respectively: 
```I want to order a basketball.```
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```

Chinese: I want to order a basketball.
English: I want to order a basketball.
French: Je veux commander un ballon de basket.
Spanish: Quiero pedir una pelota de baloncesto.

### 1.4 Simultaneous tone conversion

```python
prompt = f"""
Please translate the following text into Chinese and display it in formal and informal tones: 
```Would you like to order a pillow?```
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```Formal tone: Do you need to order a pillow?

Informal tone: Do you want to order a pillow?

### 1.5 Universal Translator

In today's globalized environment, users from different countries need to communicate frequently across languages. But language differences often make communication difficult. In order to break through language barriers and achieve more convenient international business cooperation and communication, we need an intelligent **universal translation tool**. The translation tool needs to be able to automatically identify the language of texts in different languages ​​without manual specification. It can then translate these texts in different languages ​​into the native language of the target user. In this way, users around the world can easily obtain content written in their native language.

Developing a tool that recognizes languages ​​and performs multilingual translation will greatly reduce the communication costs caused by language barriers. It will help build a language-independent global world and make the world more closely connected.

```python
user_messages = [
"The performance of the system is much slower than normal.", # System performance is slower than normal
"I can monitor the performance of my computer and it is not working properly."minan.", # My monitor has pixels that are not lighting
"Il mio mouse non funziona", # My mouse is not working
"Mój klawisz Ctrl jest zepsuty", # My keyboard has a broken control key
"My screen is flashing" # My screen is flashing
]
```

```python
import time
for issue in user_messages:
time.sleep(20)
prompt = f"Tell me what language the following text is in, output the language directly, such as French, without outputting punctuation: ```{issue}```"
lang = get_completion(prompt)
print(f"Original message ({lang}): {issue}\n")

prompt = f"""
Translate the following message into English and Chinese respectively, and write it in the format of
Chinese translation: xxx
English translation: yyy
:
```{issue}```
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response, "\n========================================")
```

Original message (French): La performance du système est plus lente que d'habitude.

Chinese translation: System performance is slower than usual.
English translation: The system performance is slower than usual. 
===========================================
Original message (Spanish): Mi monitor tiene píxeles que no se iluminan.

Chinese translation: Some pixels on my monitor are not lighting up.
English translation: My monitor has pixels that do not light up. 
=========================================== Original message (Italian): Il mio mouse non funziona

Chinese translation: My mouse is not working
English translation: My mouse is not working
=========================================== Original message (This text is in Polish.): Mój klawisz Ctrl jest zepsuty

Chinese translation: My Ctrl key is broken
English translation: My Ctrl key is broken
=========================================== Original message (Chinese): My screen is flickering

Chinese translation: My screen is flashingEnglish translation: My screen is flickering. 
=========================================

## 2. Adjustment of tone and writing style

In writing, the choice of language tone is closely related to the target audience. For example, work emails need to use a formal, polite tone and written vocabulary; while chatting with friends can use a more relaxed, colloquial tone.

Choosing the right language style to make the content more easily accepted and understood by a specific audience is a necessary ability for skilled writers. Adjusting the tone as the audience changes is also an important aspect of the intelligence of large language models in different scenarios.

```python
prompt = f"""
Translate the following text into the format of a business letter: 
```Little brother, I am Xiaoyang. Last time, how many inches of monitors did you say our department was going to purchase?```
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am Xiaoyang. I would like to confirm with you the size of the monitors our department needs to purchase. You mentioned this issue when we talked last time.

Looking forward to your reply.

Thank you!Sincerely,

Xiaoyang

## 3. File format conversion

Large language models such as ChatGPT perform well in converting between different data formats. It can easily convert between JSON and HTML, XML, Markdown and other formats. Here is an example showing how to use a large language model **to convert JSON data to HTML format**:

Suppose we have a JSON data containing the name and email information of the restaurant staff. Now we need to convert this JSON to HTML table format so that it can be displayed on the web page. In this case, we can use a large language model, directly input JSON data, and give the requirements to convert to HTML table. The language model will automatically parse the JSON structure and output it in the form of HTML table to complete the format conversion task.

Using the powerful format conversion ability of the large language model, we can quickly realize the mutual conversion between various structured data, greatly simplifying the development process. Mastering this conversion technique will help readers **process structured data more efficiently**.

```python
data_json = { "resturant employees" :[ 
{"name":"Shyam", "email":"shyamjaiswal@gmail.com"},
{"name":"Bob", "email":"bob32@gmail.com"},
{"name":"Jai", "email":"jai87@gmail.com"}
]}
```

```python
prompt = f"""
Convert the following Python dictionary from JSON to an HTML table, preserving table headers and column names: {data_json}
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```

<table>
<caption>resturant employees</caption>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>name</th>
<th>email</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Shyam</td>
<td>shyamjaiswal@gmail.com</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bob</td>
<td>bob32@gmail.com</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Jai</td>
<td>jai87@gmail.com</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Display the above HTML code as follows:

```python
from IPython.display import display, Markdown, Latex, HTML, JSON
display(HTML(response))
```

<table>
<caption>resturant employees</caption>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>name</th>
<th>email</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Shyam</td>
<td>shyamjaiswal@gmail.com</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bob</td>
<td>bob32@gmail.com</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Jai</td>
<td>jai87@gmail.com</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

## 4. Spelling and grammar correction

When writing in a non-native language, spelling and grammatical errors are common, and proofreading is particularly important. For example, when posting on a forum or writing an English paper, proofreading the text can greatly improve the quality of the content.

**Automatic proofreading using a large language model can greatly reduce the workload of manual proofreading**. Here is an example showing how to use a large language model to check the spelling and grammatical errors of a sentence.

Suppose we have a series of English sentences, some of which have errors. We can traverse each sentence and ask the language model to check it. If the sentence is correct, it will output "no error found". If there is an error, it will output the correct version after modification.

In this way, the large language model can quickly and automatically proofread a large amount of text content and locate spelling and grammar problems. This greatly reduces the burden of manual proofreading.It also ensures the quality of the text. Using the proofreading function of the language model to improve writing efficiency is an effective method that every non-native writer can adopt.

```python
text = [ 
"The girl with the black and white puppies have a ball.", # The girl has a ball.
"Yolanda has her notebook.", # ok
"Its going to be a long day. Does the car need it’s oil changed?", # Homonyms
"Their goes my freedom. There is going to bring they’re suitcases.", # Homonyms
"Your going to need you’re notebook.", # Homonyms
"That medicine effects my ability to sleep. Have you heard of the butterfly affect?", # Homonymsmonyms
"This phrase is to cherck chatGPT for spelling abilitty" # spelling
]
```

```python
for i in range(len(text)):
time.sleep(20)
prompt = f"""Please proofread and correct the following text. Note that the corrected text remains in the original language and there is no need to output the original text.
If you do not find any errors, say "No errors found".

For example:
Input: I are happy.
Output: I am happy.
```{text[i]}```"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(i, response)
```

0 The girl with the black and white puppies has a ball.
1 Yolanda has her notebook.
2 It's going to be a long day. Does the carneed its oil changed?
3 Their goes my freedom. There are going to bring their suitcases.
4 You're going to need your notebook.
5 That medicine affects my ability to sleep. Have you heard of the butterfly effect?
6 This phrase is to check chatGPT for spelling ability.

The following is a simple example of using a large language model for grammatical correction, similar to the function of Grammarly (a grammar correction and proofreading tool).

Enter a review text about a panda doll, and the language model will automatically proofread the grammatical errors in the text and output the corrected version. The Prompt used here is relatively simple and direct, and only requires grammatical correction. We can also extend Prompt and request the language model to adjust the tone and writing style of the text at the same time.

```python
text = f"""
Got this for my daughterfor her birthday cuz she keeps taking \
mine from my room. Yes, adults also like pandas too. She takes \
it everywhere with her, and it's super soft and cute. One of the \
ears is a bit lower than the other, and I don't think that was \
designed to be asymmetrical. It's a bit small for what I paid for it \
though. I think there might be other options that are bigger for \
the same price. It arrived a day earlier than expected, so I got \
to play with it myself before I gave it to my daughter.
"""
```

```python
prompt = f"Proofread and correct the following product review:```{text}```"
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```

I got this for my daughter's birthday because she keeps taking mine from my room. Yes, adults also like pandas too. She takes it everywhere with her, and it's super soft and cute. However, one of the ears is a bit lower than the other, and I don't think that was designed to be asymmetrical. It's also a bit smaller than I expected for the price. I think there might be other optionsns that are bigger for the same price. On the bright side, it arrived a day earlier than expected, so I got to play with it myself before giving it to my daughter.

Introduce the ```Redlines``` package to display and compare the error correction process in detail:

```python
# If redlines is not installed, you need to install it first
!pip3.8 install redlines
```

```python
from redlines import Redlines
from IPython.display import display, Markdown

diff = Redlines(text,response)
display(Markdown(diff.output_markdown))
```

<span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">Got</span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">I got </span>this for my <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">daughter for her </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">daughter's </span>birthday <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">cuz </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">because </span>she keeps taking mine from my <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">room.olor:red;font-weight:700;">room. </span>Yes, adults also like pandas <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">too. </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">too. </span>She takes it everywhere with her, and it's super soft and <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">cute.

This example shows how to use the powerful language processing capabilities of the language model to achieve automatic grammatical error correction. Similar methods can be used to proofread various types of text content, greatly reducing the workload of manual proofreading while ensuring the accuracy of text grammar. Mastering the skills of using language models for grammatical correction will make our writing more efficient and accurate.

## V. Comprehensive examples
Language models haveIt has powerful combined conversion capabilities, and can achieve multiple conversions at the same time through a prompt, greatly simplifying the workflow.

The following is an example showing how to use a prompt to translate, correct spelling, adjust tone, and convert format for a text at the same time.

```python
prompt = f"""
For the English comment text between the following three backticks,
First, correct spelling and grammar,
Then convert it into Chinese,
Then convert it into the style of high-quality Taobao comments, explain the advantages and disadvantages of the product from various angles, and summarize it.
Polish the description to make the comment more attractive.
The output result format is:
[Advantages] xxx
[Disadvantages] xxx
[Summary] xxx
Note that only the xxx part needs to be filled in and output in segments.
Output the result in Markdown format.
```{text}```
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
display(Markdown(response))
```

[Advantages]
- Super soft and cute, very popular as a birthday gift for my daughter.
- Adults also like pandas, and I like it too.
- Arrived a day early, which gave me time to play with it.

【Disadvantages】
- One ear is lower than the other, asymmetrical.
- The price is a bit expensive, but the size is a bit small, there may be larger options at the same price.【Summary】
This panda toy is very suitable as a birthday gift, it is soft and cute, and is loved by children. Although the price is a bit expensive, the size is a bit small, and the asymmetrical design is a bit disappointing. If you want a larger option at the same price, you may need to consider other options. Overall, this is a good panda toy and worth buying.

Through this example, we can see that the large language model can smoothly handle multiple conversion requirements and realize functions such as Chinese translation, spelling correction, tone upgrade, and format conversion.

Using the powerful combination conversion ability of the large language model, we can avoid calling the model multiple times for different conversions, which greatly simplifies the workflow. This method of realizing multiple conversions at one time can be widely used in text processing and conversion scenarios.
