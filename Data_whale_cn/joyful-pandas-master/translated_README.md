The paper version of the book based on the Joyful Pandas tutorial has been launched on major online platforms, welcome to purchase. This book uses the new version 1.4.0, and has made a lot of revisions to the web version of the tutorial (based on 1.2.0), including content additions and exercises updates, and also added three chapters on data visualization, feature engineering, and performance optimization. There are 121 design exercises in this book and 41 exercises at the end of each chapter. The distribution of each chapter and the table of contents are shown below. For any questions about this book and pandas, you can raise an issue in this repository, or add the QR code at the end to join the discussion group to ask questions.
