## Project Intention

In recent years, artificial intelligence technology represented by machine learning has gradually been recognized and popularized in many aspects. Deep learning technology has achieved widespread success in academia and industry, and has been highly valued, setting off a new round of artificial intelligence craze. Operational research, as a seemingly ancient but recently emerging discipline, is mainly composed of optimization, graph theory, combinatorial optimization... A lot of content. Optimization is a very important part of the content. Everyone is proficient in using the optimization solver, but how many people really understand and care about the real principles. Here we will take everyone to study the content related to operations research carefully and meticulously.

This course teaches and discusses the basic methods of operations research, mainly game theory, linear programming, nonlinear programming, complexity theory, combinatorial optimization, as well as stochastic processes, Markov decision processes, queuing theory and inventory theory. Regarding the algorithm theory and modeling of optimization, the main contents include optimization foundation, including unconstrained optimality theory, duality theory, constrained optimality theory, and unconstrained optimization algorithms, including gradient algorithms, Newton algorithms, quasi-Newton algorithms, and constrained optimization algorithms.Optimization algorithms, including penalty functions, etc.

Through the study of this course, we hope to master the theory and algorithm implementation of operations research and optimization algorithms, and improve the ability of artificial intelligence technology to conduct scientific research and application development. The code part uses python or matlab.

Prerequisites for learning: Understand some basic knowledge of advanced mathematics and mathematical statistics.
